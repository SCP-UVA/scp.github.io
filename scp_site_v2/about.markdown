## STEM Communication Practice at the University of Virginia

This website serves as a central hub for the activities and history of the University of Virginia semi-secret group entitled **STEM Communication Practice** (or **SCP**). Composing the group are (mostly) graduate students from various STEM departments of the university.

### Main Goal

Our **main goal** at SCP is to:

> Effectively and clearly explain a specialized subject in science to an audience that may or may not be specializing in the same field with enough attention to rigor and detail to respect the science while simultaneously respecting the intelligence of the audience. 

In particular, we seek to concretely answer our *driving questions*:

### Driving Questions:
1. Is it *possible* to communicate sophisticated results from one specialized field to another one or outside all fields of specialty?
2. In a world that's increasingly dependent on specialized experts, how do we, future experts, reach those outside our fields?
3. What specifically are the “knowledge gaps” that must be *requisitely filled* such that understanding of a particular scientific concept or practice is “unlocked?”

Though our questions seem super serious, SCP actually isn't all that serious at all. In reality, it is a place where other STEM graduate students can discuss science broadly and learn something new. For example:

### Why Attend SCP?
1. Learn about interesting science research happening right around you.
2. See how a familiar subject is presented through a different light.
3. Challenge yourself to try to learn something new.
4. Take a nice break from your own work.
5. Hang out with friends!

### Why Present at SCP?

There are also many reasons to present at SCP. 

1. Preparation for an upcoming seminar, presentation, or defense.
2. Overall practice public speaking skills.
3. Understand what students find confusing about a particular topic.
4. Solidify understanding of an idea through public exposition.
